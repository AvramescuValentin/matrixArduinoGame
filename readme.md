---- How to play ----
  At first you will see the map on an 8x8 matrix and a dot which is representing your car. On an LCD Display there will be a message "Press Start". In order to start the game, you must press the single button you have on the big breadboard. After you have pressed the button, the game will start slowly and it will increase in difficulty over time. Everytime you die, you will lose a life. After you have died, you can position your car in a spot being invincible and you need to press again the same button in order to resume the game.
  To move your car, you will use your hand, introducing motion control in this way.
  -- Game goal --
  Your Goal is to resist as long as possible in order to achieve a better score. On your way, you will have walls which must be avoided.
  -- Scoring and Difficulty --
  As you advance in this journey, the map will move faster. The score represents the amount of time you have survived.
  -- End of the game --
  After you lose all your 3 lives, the game is over.
