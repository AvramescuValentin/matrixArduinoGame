In order to start the game, you must press the single button you have on the big breadboard. After you have pressed the button, the game will start slowly and it will increase in difficulty over time. Everytime you die, you will lose a life. After you have died, you can position your car in a spot being invincible and you need to press again the same button in order to resume the game.
  To move your car, you will use your hand, introducing motion control in this way.
